`python --version` 

Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.

## Usage

First, replace 'your_epub_name' with the name of the e-book file you want to translate (without the file extension).

Ensure you have placed the epub file in the /Users/your_username/Documents/MoMo Books/BookHTML directory.

In the command line, navigate to the project folder and execute the file `pyqt5_momotranslator_gpt.py`:

`python pyqt5_momotranslator_gpt.py` 

Keep running the program as needed. Once one step is complete, the next execution will proceed to the next step until the translated epub is generated.
